# Nova Extension Testing Instructions

## Current Status
âœ… Language server has been DISABLED to avoid crashes  
âœ… JavaScript fallback completion providers are active  
âœ… Extension should work without external dependencies  

## Testing Steps

### 1. Open Extension in Development Mode
```bash
cd /Users/mert/github/nova-lang/editor_support/vscode
code .
```

### 2. Run Extension in Development
- Press `F5` or `Cmd+Shift+D` and click "Run Extension"
- This opens a new VS Code window with the extension loaded

### 3. Test Auto-completion
1. In the new window, open `test-completion.nova`
2. Go to line 21-23 where it says:
   ```nova
   // Type here to test completion:
   // pr
   // le
   // f
   ```
3. Type `pr` and press `Ctrl+Space` - should show `print` completion
4. Type `let ` and press `Ctrl+Space` - should show various completions
5. Check Developer Console (Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools) for logs:
   - Should see: `ðŸš€ Nova Language Support extension is now active!`
   - Should see: `ðŸ”¥ Nova completion provider triggered!` when typing

### 4. Alternative Simple Test
If the main extension has issues, temporarily edit `package.json`:
```json
"main": "./extension-debug.js",
```
This uses the ultra-simple debug version for testing.

## Expected Behavior
- Extension activates with message
- Completion works on `.nova` files
- Console shows detailed logging
- No language server errors (it's disabled)

## Troubleshooting
1. **No completion**: Check file has `.nova` extension
2. **Extension not loading**: Check Developer Console for errors  
3. **Still getting language server errors**: Extension may be cached - restart VS Code completely

## Files Created for Testing
- `extension-debug.js` - Minimal completion-only version
- `test-completion.nova` - Test file with completion points
- Current `extension.js` - Full version with fallback providers
